# applications

norns is uniquely oriented toward sharing. In the early days of monome, creating apps for grid and arc was relatively straightforward but there were also a lot of dependencies -- the biggest being operating systems. norns not only navigates more successfully around this by decoupling its dependence on Windows or Mac OS, but the scripting syntax at its heart is pliable and an incredibly easy to adapt chunks of code from others to create your dream instruments.

While this is not a comprehensive list of what's available, or even all of our favorites, these applications are a wonderful starting point for those looking to play, adapt, and develop.

All are available for download in maiden's [project manager](maiden/#project-manager). Each app name links back to its discussion thread on lines.

## sampling + looping

- **[compass](https://llllllll.co/t/compass/25192)**: Asynchronous looper built around the concept of a command sequencer. Commands modulate sequence, recording, playback and looping behaviors.
- **[otis](https://llllllll.co/t/22149)**: Dual "tape" delay/looper/sampler, inspired by Peter Blasser's Cocoquantus. Includes `hnds`, a bank of LFOs that can be used to modulate panning, volume, feedback, speed, record state, direction, and position of the buffer playback.
