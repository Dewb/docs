# applications

norns is uniquely oriented toward sharing. In the early days of monome, creating apps for grid and arc was relatively straightforward but there were also a lot of dependencies -- the biggest being operating systems. norns successfully navigates around this by decoupling its dependence on Windows or Mac OS. Additionally, the scripting syntax at its heart is pliable and it's incredibly easy to adapt chunks of code from others to create your dream instruments.

While this is not a comprehensive list of what's available, or even all of our favorites, these projects are a wonderful starting point for those looking to play, adapt, and develop.

All are available for download in maiden's [project manager](maiden/#project-manager). Each app name links back to its discussion thread on lines.

## sampling + looping

- **[compass](https://llllllll.co/t/compass/25192)**: Asynchronous looper built around the concept of a command sequencer. Commands modulate sequence, recording, playback and looping behaviors.
- **[otis](https://llllllll.co/t/22149)**: Dual "tape" delay/looper/sampler, inspired by Peter Blasser's Cocoquantus. Includes `hnds`, a bank of LFOs that can be used to modulate panning, volume, feedback, speed, record state, direction, and position of the buffer playback.

## sequencing

*nb. Many of these projects rely on additional sound engines which must be installed beforehand. We've made an effort to list requirements, but if you're missing anything [maiden will tell you](help/#load-fail).

- **[ekombi](https://llllllll.co/t/ekombi/26812)**: Four tracks of polyrhythmic and euclidean beats (WIP)
- **[fugu](https://llllllll.co/t/fugu/21033)**: Multi-playhead sequencer inspired by "Fugue Machine" for iOS. Requires `molly_the_polly` engine. Speaks MIDI to sequence external instruments.
