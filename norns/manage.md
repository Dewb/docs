# managing data on norns

There are a few types of data that you will collect on norns: projects / apps, sound files, and presets.

In this section, we'll review the tools which can help you confidently add, change, transfer, and remove data from norns:

- [maiden](/maiden): A custom browser-based tool that's built into norns. Use this to download new projects (apps) for norns, write your own scripts, and monitor behind-the-scenes system messages.
- [webDAV](/webdav): A protocol which allows you to connect norns to a Mac (via WIFI) and browse the contents of norns like you would a thumb drive. Use this to import/export audio files or to back up your scripts and presets.
- [SFTP](/sftp): A client which allows you to connect norns to a PC or Mac (via WIFI) and browse the contents of norns like you would a thumb drive. Same uses as webDAV.
