# scripting

code as musical language.

scripts describe to norns how to function. through scripts, an encoder can become a scrollable playhead, a button might trigger a flurry of arpeggios.

you don't need to know how to program before you're able to write a script. wanting to learn is the fundamental prerequisite, the same as any other language. 

to help bridge the gap between left and right brain, we've developed and collected a number of norns-specific resources. through these landing pages, you'll learn more about the artist-centric programming interface at the core of norns:

- [studies](../studies) // comprehensive tutorials on individual components of norns, highly beginner-friendly
- [reference](../reference) // an example-centric version of the norns API, for advanced use
