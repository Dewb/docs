# norns studies

comprehensive tutorials on individual elements of the norns ecosystem. through these resources, you'll learn how to translate your musical ideas into Lua scripts and how to extend those scripts to speak with all kinds of friends.

### core concepts:

- [many tomorrows](../study-1/) // variables, simple maths, keys + encoders
- [patterning](../study-2/) // screen drawing, for/while loops, tables
- [spacetime](../study-3/) // functions, parameters, time
- [physical](../study-4/) // incorporating grids + midi
- [streams](../study-5/) // system polls, osc, file storage

### extended techniques:
- [softcut studies](../softcut/) // a multi-voice sample playback and recording system built into norns
- [clock studies](../clocks/) // create timed and clock-synced function calls: loops, repetition, and delays

### micro:
- [grid recipes](../grid-recipes/) // short snippets of code for canonical grid interactions
- [norns: tutorial](https://llllllll.co/t/norns-tutorial/23241) // chunked examples that reveal the idiosyncrasies of the core norns concepts from [Devine Lu Linvega](https://xxiivv.com)
