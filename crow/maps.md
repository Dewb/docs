# maps

to supplement crow's [script reference](https://monome.org/docs/crow/reference/), which outlines each individual command which crow can execute in a factual manner, **maps** offers a musical framework through which crow can be explored. these videos begin as livestreams and are uploaded for asynchronous viewing.

this sections of the docs is a text companion to the 'fundamental learning' sections of these videos. here, you'll find code and reflections on some of the compositional scenarios Trent explores in the full-length episodes.
